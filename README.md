# Who did we design this App for?
Everyone as all of us needs to store password and use them in future. UI is designed in such a way that even a small child can use it efficiently without any confusion. UX is designed for the users on go so that they can use it efficiently.
# Inspiration for this Project
We decided to take part in CODE JAM by Tech with Tim, a 30 days long hackathon with the theme "Generator". The three of us did a lot of brainstorming and then came up with the 
idea of a "Password Generator" app. We came up with quite a few challenges and learnt a lot solving them.
