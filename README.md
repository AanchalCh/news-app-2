# Inspiration for this Project
We decided to take part in CODE JAM by Tech with Tim , a 30 days long hackathon with the theme "Generator". The three of us did a lot of brainstorming and then came up with the 
idea of a "Password Generator" app. We came up with quite a few challenges and learnt a lot solving them.
